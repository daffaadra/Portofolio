# File Descriptions
Files in this folder are codes in R format. These codes were made as part of projects throughout my year studying at Universitas Indonesia under Statistics major, Department of Mathematics.  
## ARIMA Forecasting
This project uses ARIMA model to forecast future values of a stock security. Steps involved in the project are:
1. Stationary testing
2. Model Specification
3. Model Diagnostic
4. Overfitting test and parameter estimation
5. Forecasting

## Classification
Classification method is used for this project to group the dataset into two groups. The supervised learning method divided "Body Measurements" data into two parts. 

## Geographically Weighted Regression 
The Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) project analyzes factors contributing to unemployement in West Java due to COVID-19 pandemic. Apart from using GWR model, the project also compares its performance to classical linear regression method. The steps involved in the project are:
1. Building classical linear regression method based on data.
2. Checking model assumptions, if all of them are fulfilled proceed to step 3
3. Checking spatial dependencies on the data using Moran I test and Lagrange Multiplier
4. Building spatial regression models including Spatial Autoregressive, Spatial Error Model (SEM), General Spatial Model (GSM), Spatial Durbin Model (SDM), Spatial Durbin Error Model, (SDEM), General Nested Spatial Model (GNSM), and Spatial Lag Exogenus Model (SLX)
5. Model adequacy checking including: Likelihood ratio test, Shapiro Wilk, Breusch Pagan, Moran I.
6. Model selection with AIC
   
## Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering method is used for this project regarding infectious disease across the then-33 provinces of Indonesia. The method splits the data into clusters in agglomerative manner. Two methods of hierarchical clustering is used: Complete Linkage and Ward. The result of each methods are shown in dendrograms. For further analysis, the sufficient amount of clusters to represent the data can be shown through an elbow plot.

## Mini Project Analisis Survival
This mini project is a case study of expected patient death with the use of ICU ventilator using survival and hazard functions. There are four survival functions in this project that has its own criterions, which are:
1. Without criterion
2. Comorbidity
3. Age 
4. Comorbidity and Age

## Principal Component Analysis
Principal Component Analysis method is used to group multiple categories in Switzerland data based on underlying conditions, more known as dimensions. This "Swiss" data categories consist of fertility, agriculture, examination, education, religion (Catholic), and Infant Mortality. Principal Component Analysis uses eigen value in the process. To determine the number of dimensions, scree plot was used. As a result of PCA, the data can be grouped into two groups.
