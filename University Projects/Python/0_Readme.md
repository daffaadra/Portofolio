# File Descriptions

## IISMA Course Series Word Cloud Coding
This is the coding file of a YouTube crash course that is part of Indonesia International Student Mobility Awards (IISMA) 2022 challenge. 
This course's topic is word clould made from review aggregate website Tripadvisor. Hotel reviews are being used for this project.

## Jupyter Homework 1
This project consists of sentiment analysis using Python's tools such as NLTK and TextBlob.
Topics covered in this file including Word Count, Word Cloud, Subjectivity, and Polarity

## Supervised Learning
Supervised Learning in this Python-based project is divided into two parts. The topics covered including data load KNN Clustering, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
Apart from the methods, this project also elaborated the process of loading data into python using external sources and inclusive package.

### Part 1
The main objective of Part 1 is to perform KNN Clustering and do prediction. 
Additionally, this file splits the dataset into training and testing to evaluate the model's accuracy.

### Part 2
The main objective of Part 1 is to use Decision Tree and Random Forest methods. 
Preceding to Decision Tree usage, an exploratory correlation is used. 

## Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning focuses on K-Means clustering that groups the dataset into 2 and 3 clusters.
Data regarding customers of a mall is being used for this simple project.
