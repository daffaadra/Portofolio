# Thesis (Skripsi)
These two codes are part of my undergraduate thesis titled "Analysis of Spotify's Audio Features Trends using Time Series Decomposition and Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Model".
The thesis objective is to further analyze musical trends on the streaming platform since the beginning of 2017 until mid 2013 from the 200 most popular songs (based on streams) weekly. Data for this project are collected from Spotify's official chart website and the platform's Developer API. This project is divided into two parts: decomposition of the data and analysis using Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model. Methods used for the decomposition part are Seasonal/Classical Decomposition and Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Based on Loess (Locally Estimated Regression). For the VAR part, this project started with building the model, estimating the parameters, and forecasting future values.
