# Thesis (Skripsi)

These two codes are part of my undergraduate thesis titled "Analysis of Spotify's Audio Features Trends using Time Series Decomposition and Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Model".
- Thesis Objective: Analyze musical trends on the streaming platform since the beginning of 2017 until mid 2023 from the 200 most popular songs (based on streams) weekly.
- Data for this project are collected from Spotify's official chart website and the platform's Developer API.
- This project is divided into two parts:
  1. Time series decomposition of the data using Seasonal/Classical Decomposition and Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Based on Loess (Locally Estimated Regression).
  2. Analysis using Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model. This part covers building the model, estimating the parameters, and forecasting future values.
